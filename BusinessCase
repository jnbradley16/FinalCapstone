  - What's the general population of the surrounding area?
  - What competition is nearby that could drive traffic away from our future restaurant? 
      - Sit-Down restaurants vs Quick Service restaurants in the area
  - What businesses are nearby that could be beneficial to our future restaurant?
      - Universities, hospitals, corporate offices, theaters, etc..
  - How far away is it to any restaurant we currently have in the Tampa area?
